# GHK

My name is Rich Minchuk. I’m developing an open source project called GHK. It’s based around a few simple concepts.

1. Develop a tool that others can use - out of the box - to grow their own personal brand.
2. Use some brand new tech to show off what I’m learning while building it.
3. Make it unbelievably simple to install.
4. Rely on mostly free tools to bring exceptional value to users.
5. Blog about everything I learn.

_I am activly developing GHK in a private repository until my initial beta release._

## src/

`src` is a class library project that can be packed into a NuGet package. This NuGet package will power new MVC projects, providing powerful tools to grow your personal brand.
